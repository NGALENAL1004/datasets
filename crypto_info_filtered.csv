Prediction markets like Augur v2 are designed so users can place bets on a variety of different events. With this fork, Augur v2 rolled out a suite of improvements around dispute management, settlements, forking, and more. 
Prediction markets are widely considered the best forecasting tool. Augur is an open, global platform where anyone anywhere can create, monitor or trade in prediction markets about any topic. Think of it as an ""Early Warning System'' with the most accurate event forecasts, a potential ""Google Search"", ""Bloomberg Terminal"" or ""Reuters Terminal"" for crowdsourced event forecasts.
The system plans to use the ""Wisdom of Crowds'' (""collective intelligence'') via market incentives, ""Long Tail'' dynamics and blockchain technology to securely generate a more accurate, robust and unfiltered array of dynamic event forecasts than any alternative can match.
Augur is decentralized, self-regulating, pseudonymous and autonomous. It offers the promise of markets without exposure to counterparty risk, principal-agent problems or central points of control, failure or censorship. No person is ever in direct control of someone else’s funds or in a position to single-handedly threaten the system’s integrity.
The software is comprised of smart contracts perpetually deployed on a blockchain network, which enables applications deployed to be immune to local outages while benefiting from the entire community's security. All interactions with markets are communicated as database transactions between unique accounts powered by immutable software instructions.

Launched on Dec 25, 2016, Obyte is a distributed ledger based on directed acyclic graph (DAG). The team claims that due to the absence of blocks and miners, access to Obyte ledger is decentralized, disintermediated, free (as in freedom), equal, and open.

Obyte claims to be the first DAG-based cryptocurrency platform to support dApps. Due to the absence of miners and blocks, the team claims that there is no risk of front-running and other miner manipulation, and dApps are safer and easier to develop than blockchain-based dApps. DApps are developed in Oscript - a new language that avoids many unsafe programming patterns common in earlier dApp platforms.

The team believes that Obyte is especially well suited for DeFi apps; some are already available on the platform, such as Bonded Stablecoins (https://ostable.org), while some are being developed.

Other features include self-sovereign identity, private untraceable currencies, sending crypto to email using textcoins, and extremely small-footprint libraries suitable for small IoT devices.",,,,871,False,"{'Access': 'Permissionless', 'FCA': 'Utility', 'FINMA': 'Utility', 'Industry': 'Blockchain-Specific Application', 'CollateralizedAsset': 'No', 'CollateralizedAssetType': '', 'CollateralType': '', 'CollateralInfo': ''}","{'Weiss': {'Rating': 'D', 'TechnologyAdoptionRating': 'D-', 'MarketPerformanceRating': 'C'}}",True,1000000.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,2016-12-25,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/asset-management/821/1671206463204.pdf,https://obyte.org/,1000000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,blockchain,,,,,,
